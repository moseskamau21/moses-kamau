                <h2>Early Years: Seeds of Curiosity</h2>
                <p>
                    I was born in 1999 in Othaya, Nyeri County, Kenya. My earliest memory involving technology 
                    was watching my father repair our home radio. The intricate circuits, the careful soldering, 
                    the transformation from silence to sound - it seemed like magic. That curiosity about how 
                    things work sparked a journey that continues today.
                </p>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>First Steps with Technology</h2>
                <p>
                    My real introduction to computers came in Class 4 at St Teresa Kanyange Academy. Our school 
                    had just received five donated computers from a government program. I'll never forget that 
                    first computer lab session - the quiet hum of the machines, the glow of the monitors, the 
                    feeling that a door was opening to something bigger.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While most of my classmates saw it as just another lesson, for me it was the beginning of 
                    everything. I started staying behind during breaks, tinkering, exploring. When a teacher 
                    accidentally deleted a file and I found it in the Recycle Bin, I suddenly became the class 
                    "computer expert." That small victory gave me confidence.
                </p>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Education Journey</h2>
                <p>
                    At Kagumo High School, I wanted to study Computer Studies, but there were limited spots and 
                    I didn't get in. I ended up taking Agriculture instead. But my passion for technology didn't 
                    fade. I'd finish my agriculture classes and head straight to the computer lab after school. 
                    The teacher noticed my interest and let me practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I taught myself coding from textbooks left on the shelf. Getting my first program - a simple 
                    calculator - to run felt like a real victory. It was just basic script, built through trial 
                    and error with no teacher, but it worked. That's when I knew technology was my path.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>University: Finding My Place</h2>
                <p>
                    After high school, I initially joined JKUAT for Industrial Mathematics, but my heart wasn't 
                    in it. Mid-program, I made the difficult decision to drop out and start fresh. In 2021, I 
                    joined Dedan Kimathi University of Technology to study Information Technology - finally 
                    pursuing what I was truly passionate about.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DeKUT transformed me. Courses like Introduction to Programming, Database Systems, Web 
                    Development, and Mobile Application Development gave me structure. But the real learning 
                    happened through projects - building a Student Management System, creating a church donation 
                    tracker, and ultimately, developing B-FIT GYM Manager.

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Philosophy: Technology for African Contexts</h2>
                <p>
                    My time at DeKUT taught me something crucial: the best solutions for Africa come from people 
                    who understand African contexts. Technology isn't about using the most advanced tools - it's 
                    about using the most appropriate ones.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I build applications, I think mobile-first because that's how Kenyans access technology. 
                    I integrate M-Pesa because that's our financial infrastructure. I design for spotty connectivity 
                    and varying digital literacy levels because that's our reality. This contextual understanding 
                    is what makes solutions actually work.
                </p>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
                <p>
                    As I approach graduation in April 2026, I'm excited about what comes next. I want to build 
                    more solutions that serve African markets. I want to mentor younger students the way my 
                    teachers mentored me. I want to prove that African innovation can lead globally, not just 
                    follow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This journey from a curious kid in Othaya to a graduating IT student at DeKUT represents 
                    more than personal achievement. It represents the possibility that technology education 
                    creates - the ability to see problems and build solutions, to transform ideas into reality, 
                    to make a tangible difference in your community.
